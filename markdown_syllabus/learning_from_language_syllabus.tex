\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This graduate seminar will focus on the question of what types of
semantic knowledge might we be learning from being exposed to natural
language. Consider two thought experiments: (1) Imagine if everything
humans knew, they learned from personally doing things and from
observing others do things. (2) Now imagine if the only source of
information was language: we can talk to others, read, but not
experience things for ourselves. The actual case is that people learn
from their own experiences, from observing others, and also from
language in its various forms. This brings us to the question: What
aspects of semantic knowledge, if any, do we learn exclusively from
language? Which semantic domains are especially impacted by our
experiences with language? What kind of information is especially
well-represented in language, and what kind if absent? Do some languages
``teach'' their speakers things that other languages don't?

\hypertarget{course-learning-outcomes}{%
\section{Course Learning Outcomes}\label{course-learning-outcomes}}

Students will\ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  become familiar with a diverse literature linking language, cognition,
  and perception
\item
  be able to think critically about correlational vs.~causal claims
\item
  understand the basics of word embedding models and the core principles
  of natural language processing
\item
  design an experiment to test hypotheses about relationships between
  language and semantic knowledge
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{expectations}{%
\section{Expectations}\label{expectations}}

Students are expected to read the 2-5 readings assigned for each class.
I expect students to critically engage with each reading. Be on the
lookout for ideas that challenge your intuitions, and that provoke you
into thinking differently. To help you engage with the readings, each
student will be randomly assigned to a group of 2-3 for each week. After
reading the papers individually, the group should get together to
discuss the readings and -- working together -- fill out a
\emph{Response Sheet} (see
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N3eQQd40xufCTC0irJMPP7barnsBlyDQFh5fp9LLJpM/edit?usp=sharing}{Template}.
Each group should upload the completed template to Canvas by 9pm
Tuesday. I will grade each response sheet on a 1-5 scale and will use
your responses to organize the discussion for the following class.
Please note that some weeks have more/longer readings than other weeks.
Plan your schedule accordingly. Final projects will also be completed in
groups. Each group has the option of choosing to write a
review/synthesis paper, or an empirical paper. Empirical papers can take
the form of an experimental paper in which you collect your own data
(either in the lab or online)\footnote{I may be able to add you to one
  of my IRB protocols so you wouldn't need to write your own.}, a paper
introducing new computational model or a series of simulations, or a
paper based on corpus analyses.

\section{Ethics of Being a Student in the Department of
Psychology}\label{ethics-of-being-a-student-in-the-department-of-psychology}}

The members of the faculty of the Department of Psychology at UW-Madison
uphold the highest ethical standards of teaching and research. They
expect their students to uphold the same standards of ethical conduct.
By registering for this course, you are implicitly agreeing to conduct
yourself with the utmost integrity throughout the semester.

In the Department of Psychology, acts of academic misconduct are taken
very seriously. Such acts diminish the educational experience for all
involved -- students who commit the acts, classmates who would never
consider engaging in such behaviors, and instructors. Academic
misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments and
exams, stealing exams, sabotaging the work of classmates, submitting
fraudulent data, plagiarizing the work of classmates or published and/or
online sources, acquiring previously written papers and submitting them
(altered or unaltered) for course assignments, collaborating with
classmates when such collaboration is not authorized, and assisting
fellow students in acts of misconduct. Students who have knowledge that
classmates have engaged in academic misconduct should report this to the
instructor.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\section{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities
of an active participant in UW-Madison's community of scholars in which
everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic
integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of
the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of
academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This
includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course,
disciplinary probation, or suspension. Substantial or repeated cases of
misconduct will be forwarded to the Office of Student Conduct \&
Community Standards for additional review. For more information, refer
to studentconduct.wiscweb.wisc.edu/academic-integrity/.

\hypertarget{accommodations-policy}{%
\section{Accommodations Policy}\label{accommodations-policy}}

\emph{McBurney Disability Resource Center syllabus statement:} ``The
University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled
students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison
policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities
be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable
accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and
student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty {[}me{]}
of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third
week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been
incurred or recognized. Faculty {[}I{]}, will work either directly with
the student {[}you{]} or in coordination with the McBurney Center to
identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability
information, including instructional accommodations as part of a
student's educational record, is confidential and protected under
FERPA.''
\url{http://mcburney.wisc.edu/facstaffother/faculty/syllabus.php}

\_UW-Madison students who have experienced sexual misconduct (which can
include sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and/or
stalking) also have the right to request academic accommodations. This
right is afforded them under Federal legislation (Title IX). Information
about services and resources (including information about how to request
accommodations) is available through Survivor Services, a part of
University Health Services:

\hypertarget{diversity-and-inclusion}{%
\section{Diversity and Inclusion}\label{diversity-and-inclusion}}

\emph{Institutional statement on diversity:} ``Diversity is a source of
strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the
contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their
identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and
opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the
pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as
inextricably linked goals.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by
creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every
background -- people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin
and the world.'' \url{https://diversity.wisc.edu/}

\hypertarget{complaints}{%
\section{Complaints}\label{complaints}}

Occasionally, a student may have a complaint about a TA or course
instructor. If that happens, you should feel free to discuss the matter
directly with the TA or instructor. If the complaint is about the TA and
you do not feel comfortable discussing it with the individual, you
should discuss it with the course instructor. Complaints about mistakes
in grading should be resolved with the TA and/or instructor in the great
majority of cases. If the complaint is about the instructor (other than
ordinary grading questions) and you do not feel comfortable discussing
it with the individual, make an appointment to speak to the Associate
Chair for Graduate Studies, Professor Paula Niedenthal,
\href{mailto:niedenthal@wisc.edu}{\nolinkurl{niedenthal@wisc.edu}}.

If you have concerns about climate or bias in this class, or if you wish
to report an incident of bias or hate that has occurred in class, you
may contact the Chair of the Department, Professor Craig Berridge
(\href{mailto:berridge@wisc.edu}{\nolinkurl{berridge@wisc.edu}}) or the
Chair of the Psychology Department Climate \& Diversity Committee,
Professor Catherine Marler
(\href{mailto:catherine.marler@wisc.edu}{\nolinkurl{catherine.marler@wisc.edu}}).
You may also use the University's bias incident reporting system, which
you can reach at the following link:

\hypertarget{concerns-about-sexual-misconduct}{%
\section{Concerns about Sexual
Misconduct}\label{concerns-about-sexual-misconduct}}

All students deserve to be safe and respected at UW-Madison.
Unfortunately, we know that sexual and relationship violence do happen
here. Free, confidential resources are available on and off campus for
students impacted by sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence,
and stalking (regardless of when the violence occurred). You don't have
to label your experience to seek help. Friends of survivors can reach
out for support too. A list of resources can be found at
\url{https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor-resources/}

If you wish to speak to someone in the Department of Psychology about
your concerns, you may contact the Chair or any of the Associate Chairs
(\url{https://psych.wisc.edu/people/staff-2/}). Please note that all of
these individuals are Responsible Employees
(\url{https://compliance.wisc.edu/titleix/mandatory-reporting/\#responsible-employees}).
