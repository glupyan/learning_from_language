\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}

This course was born from the conviction that graduate students do not
get sufficient time to (1) think about the ``big picture'' of the
project that we as social scientists are engaged in and (2) to have
hands-on experience with scientific and expositional best-practices.
This is especially important now, as decades-old defaults about null
hypothesis testing, statistical power, and expectations concerning open
data, are being overturned.

\section{Course Learning Outcomes}\label{course-learning-outcomes}

This course will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Give you a stronger background in producing empirical research that is
  informed by insights from philosophy of science, statistical truths
  (which are frequently counter-intuitive), and real-world issues that
  researchers encounter when conducting psychological research.
\item
  Provide models for efficient data-management, analysis pipelines,
  data-visualization, and reproducible workflow--practices essential for
  producing high quality research and saving you time and nerves.
\item
  Improve the clarity and precision of your presentations and writing
  skills through workshopping and peer-feedback.
\item
  Professionalize your approach to doing science.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expectations}\label{expectations}

Students will need to read and critically engage with all the assigned
readings. Look for passages that you find especially challenging,
thought provoking, or controversial. To help you engage with the
readings and to avoid falling behind, you will be expected to post a
Question, Response, or Comment (QRC) for each reading by Monday 8pm
prior to each class. There will also be a number of assignments, as
noted on the schedule below. The assignments are due on Tuesday at 8pm
before class. Detailed instructions about each assignment will be
provided at least 2 weeks before the due date. You will want to do the
readings for the week the assignment is due before starting the
assignment. Please note that some weeks have considerably more reading
than other weeks. Plan your schedule accordingly.

\subsection{Ethics of Being a Student in the Department of
Psychology:}\label{ethics-of-being-a-student-in-the-department-of-psychology}

The members of the faculty of the Department of Psychology at UW-Madison
uphold the highest ethical standards of teaching and research. They
expect their students to uphold the same standards of ethical conduct.
By registering for this course, you are implicitly agreeing to conduct
yourself with the utmost integrity throughout the semester.

In the Department of Psychology, acts of academic misconduct are taken
very seriously. Such acts diminish the educational experience for all
involved -- students who commit the acts, classmates who would never
consider engaging in such behaviors, and instructors. Academic
misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments and
exams, stealing exams, sabotaging the work of classmates, submitting
fraudulent data, plagiarizing the work of classmates or published and/or
online sources, acquiring previously written papers and submitting them
(altered or unaltered) for course assignments, collaborating with
classmates when such collaboration is not authorized, and assisting
fellow students in acts of misconduct. Students who have knowledge that
classmates have engaged in academic misconduct should report this to the
instructor.

\subsection{Complaints:}\label{complaints}

Occasionally, a student may have a complaint about a TA or course
instructor. If that happens, you should feel free to discuss the matter
directly with the TA or instructor. If the complaint is about the TA and
you do not feel comfortable discussing it with him or her, you should
discuss it with the course instructor. Complaints about mistakes in
grading should be resolved with the TA and/or instructor in the great
majority of cases. If the complaint is about the instructor (other than
ordinary grading questions) and you do not feel comfortable discussing
it with him or her, make an appointment to speak to the Associate Chair
for Undergraduate Studies, Professor Maryellen MacDonald,
\href{mailto:mcmacdonald@wisc.edu}{\nolinkurl{mcmacdonald@wisc.edu}}.

If your complaint concerns sexual harassment, you may also take your
complaint to Dr.~Linnea Burk, Clinical Associate Professor and Director,
Psychology Research and Training Clinic, Room 315 Psychology (262-9079;
\href{mailto:burk@wisc.edu}{\nolinkurl{burk@wisc.edu}}).

If you have concerns about climate or bias in this class, or if you wish
to report an incident of bias or hate that has occurred in class, you
may contact the Chair of the Psychology Department Climate \& Diversity
Committee, Karl Rosengren
(\href{mailto:krosengren@wisc.edu}{\nolinkurl{krosengren@wisc.edu}}).
You may also use the University's bias incident reporting system, which
you can reach at the following link:
\url{https://doso.students.wisc.edu/services/bias-reporting-process/}.

\subsection{Accommodations Policy:}\label{accommodations-policy}

The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled
students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison
policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities
be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable
accommodations for students with disabilities is a shared faculty and
student responsibility. Students are expected to inform faculty {[}me{]}
of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third
week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been
incurred or recognized. Faculty {[}I{]}, will work either directly with
the student {[}you{]} or in coordination with the McBurney Center to
identify and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability
information, including instructional accommodations, as part of a
student's educational record is confidential and protected under FERPA.
